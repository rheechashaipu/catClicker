Disclaimer: The MVC setup in script.js borrows heavily from the solution code. 

The added on "admin" feature is my creation alone.

To use, open the index.html file and select a cat from the cat list (above the picture of the cat). Clicking on the cat picture will increment
the click counter (shown below the cat picture) by one click. 

You may change the name of the cat, set a new click count (use integers), and even change the 
cat picture. To do this, click the "Admin Mode" button to open up a set of input fields in which you may make the desired changes. To save and apply these changes, click the "Save Changes" button. To exit the admin features and clear the input fields, click "Cancel and Close Admin."

This project was done as an exercise on MVC as well as practicing Javascript and DOM interactions. Please be kind, I'm still a noob at all this.


Thanks,

Richard
